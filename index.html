        <p class="para"> My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and read in the 7th standard. Reading helps me to play around and stretch the boundaries of my imagination. This hobby can be developed by anyone though I got this naturally. Reading books keeps me happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in life.

              Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling.
              <br>
              The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people). 
              <br>
              Harry Potter, apparently, turns out to be my favourite character in the story. He is an extremely strong character with a unique personality that makes the series even more interesting. He bacame an orphan at a very young age when he was only 1 years old and survives a deathly curse, but in the incident his parents are killed. He grows up with his mother's non-magical elder sister and her husband who partially neglect and manhandle him. He lived a miserable life till he comes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and meets his two best friend, Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley. They are together referred too as the Golden Trio as they accompany him on all of the adventures. He still felt lonely to not have any parental figure to care for him in his life until in his 3rd year when he dicovers that his Godfather, Sirius Orion Black is still alive. He was the first person Harry could ever open to in his life. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Throughout the series, the Headmaster of his school, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, helps him in acheiving his mission and avenging his parents death by killing the Dark Lord, Tom Marvolo Riddle aka Voldemort. He also discovers deep and emotional truths about his parents' lives as he grows up. Some of the other characters of the story also have an incredibly strong backstory and one of these characters are Professor Severus Snape, the most hated potions master Hogwarts has ever seen. Later in the story, however, it turns out that he wanted to protect Harry's life as a vow to his childhood crush, Harry's mom, Lily Marie Evans. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The series ends with Voldemort's death, however, all the people who ever loved Harry or had gained his respect at some point in the series die in the battle protecting him. It includes his Godfather, Remus Lupin (one of his father's best friend and his favourite proffesor), most of the Order members (such as Alastor Moody, Nymphadora Tonks & Kingsley Shacklebolt), Albus Dumbledore and even Prf. Snape. It's a bit sad to see him lose all the people he ever loved and at the same time goes on to prove the strength of his charcter.
